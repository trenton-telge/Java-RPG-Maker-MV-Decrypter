# Trenton's RPGMV Decryptor
Forked from Petschko's RPG-Maker-MV File-Decrypter

## What is it?
This app is used to decrypt RPGMV resource files or directories that are encrypted with the built-in encryption of RPGMaker MV.

### Which Files can be decrypted with this Program?
You can decrypt files with the extension `.rpgmvp`, `.rpgmvm` or `.rpgmvo`.
This includes most audio, image, and video files present in RPGMaker MV projects.

## Requirements
- Java 11 or higher
- Any OS (Linux, Windows, IOS etc)

## How To Use
- Just double click on the JAR then the Program should start *(If not try the BAT-File - Windows only)*
- Click on the Menu "File" then "Open"
  - Browse to the RPG-Maker MV Project which you want decrypt
  - Select the Main-Directory of the Project (The Folder where the Game.exe is) on click on "Choose Directory"
- Wait for a short moment =)
- If there are Files listed and a Decryption-Key is in the Text-Box you're ready to Decrypt
  - Then go into the Menu and click "Decrypt" -> "All Files"
  - After a short moment you're done =)
  - You can find the Files now within the "Output"-Directory, which is in the same Directory as this Program. *(If you not changed it already via "File" -> "Change Output-Directory...")*

- You can also Decrypt single/multiple Files - Select them in the Project-Files Tab after that you go to "Decrypter" -> "Selected Files"
- You can also check out the "Option"-Menu and check if the settings fit to you =)
- You can find this "Manual" also within the "Info"-Menu
